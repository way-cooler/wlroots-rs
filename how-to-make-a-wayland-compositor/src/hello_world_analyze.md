# Analyzing the code
After explaining what each change gives us, I'll then explain what each line of code does.

At the end of each chapter there will be a list of suggestions and challenges
which I suggest you at least read over if not try. They exist to encourage you
to read through the [wlroots-rs
 documentation](http://way-cooler.org/docs/wlroots/index.html) and [Wayland
 documentation](https://wayland.freedesktop.org/docs/html/) in order to better
familiarize yourself.

## Logging setup
```rust
{{#include 1-hello-world/main.rs:6}}
```
This line is not strictly necessary for the compositor to run. wlroots (and
wlroots-rs) prints a log message each time something interesting happens which
is useful for debugging. In general, you should always have this line in your
compositor.

The first parameter is the minimum level that is logged. The second parameter is
an optional callback that will be called each time a message is logged.

You can log a message using this system by using the `wlr_log!`
macro<sup>1</sup>. Here is an example:

```rust
// It has the same syntax as println! or format!
wlr_log!(WLR_DEBUG, "This is an example {:?}", some_struct)
```

The first parameter is the log level you want to log at. Any arguments after
 that are passed to `format!` with the format string being the second argument.


```rust
{{#include 1-hello-world/main.rs:7}}
```
This is the real meat of the program.

This creates a builder for a `Compositor`. There can only be one `Compositor`
object per process<sup>2</sup> . The builder is how Wayland globals and their
callbacks are set up.

In this case no callbacks are set up the `Compositor` is just immediately built.
When you build the compositor, just like you build any object in wlroots-rs, you
need to give it user state. In this case, there is no state to store so you can
just pass the unit type `()`.

Once the `Compositor` is set up `run` can be called. This will put it in
the main Wayland event loop listening for events and dispatching to the
callbacks. It will keep running until `wlroots::terminate` is called. Since this
is never called in this compositor it won't happen until it's killed via a 
signal.

<sup>1</sup> Don't forget to import macros by prepending `#[macro_use]` to 
`extern crate wlroots`.

<sup>2</sup> wlroots-rs is not designed to be thread safe with its objects. Most
objects are `!Send` and `!Sync`.
